# grug iter

Golang iterators for mediocre programmers like me.

We implement a pull iterator, drawing heavy inspiration from Rust.
The scaffolding in `grug.go` is less than 70 lines of code.
Check out `main.go`

### Features

- Custom iterators on structs
- Ability to map functions onto iterators
- Ability to filter elements from an iterator
