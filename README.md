# grug iter

Golang iterators for mediocre programmers like me.

This is not a library yet.

The implementation is that of a pull iterator, drawing
heavy inspiration from the Rust counterpart.

The scaffolding for the iterators is less than 70 lines of code.
Check out `main.go`

### Features

- Custom iterators on structs
- Ability to map functions onto iterators
- Ability to filter elements from an iterator
